# Writers Block
Writers Block was developed by members of the Brown RISD Game Developers, a student game development organization run by students at Brown University and the Rhode Island School of Design.

Development took place over the course of 24 hours, spread out across 4-hour weekly meetings and one 8 hour mini-game jam during the 2019 spring semester.
